Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume. (Eg: A filter in the first layer of a ConvNet might have size [5, 5, 3]). During the forward pass, we convolve (\"slide\") each filter across the width and height of the input volume and compute element-wise dot products between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. As we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume we will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. Each convolutional layer will have such a set of filters, and each of them will produce a separate 2-dimensional activation map. We then stack these activation maps along the depth-dimension to produce the output volume.\n",

        "Deciding on the architecture for a CNN, i.e. the combination of convolution, pooling, dense, and other layers, can be tricky and often can seem arbitrary. On top of that, one also has to make decisions such as what kind of pooling, which activation functions, and what size of convolution to use, among other things. For new and old practitioners of deep learning, these choices can be overwhelming. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, by examining existing successful CNN architectures we can learn a lot about what works and what doesn't. (We can even apply these existing architectures to our problems since many deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and Keras, have them [built in](https://keras.io/applications/#available-models) and it is even possible to fine-tune pre-trained models to our specific problem using [transfer learning](https://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/).)\n",

        "[This article](https://medium.com/@sidereal/cnns-architectures-lenet-alexnet-vgg-googlenet-resnet-and-more-666091488df5) describes many of the most successful CNN architectures in recent years, including [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [Inception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v3.pdf) and [VGG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf). For a more detailed and technical description of these models and more see [these slides](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture9.pdf). Reading through these resources should give you insights into why these architectures are successful as well as best practices and current trends for CNNs that will help you design your own architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, one of the practices you might pick up on is the use of 3x3 convolutions. You'll notices that older architectures such as [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) used a range of convolutions from 7x7 down to 3x3. However, newer architectures such as VGG and ResNet use 3x3 convolutions almost exclusively. In short, the reason is that stacking 3x3 convolutions gives you the same receptive field as a larger convolution but with more non-linearity. \n",

        "1. [**ALL**] Experiment with the network architecture, try changing the numbers, types and sizes of layers, the sizes of filters, using different padding etc. How do these decisions affect the performance of the model? In particular, try building a *fully convolutinoal* network, with no (max-)pooling layers. \n",
        "2. [**ALL**] Add BATCH NORMALISATION ([Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) and [research paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/ioffe15.pdf)) to improve the model's generalisation.\n",
        "3. [**ADVANCED**] Read about Residual networks ([original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), ) and add **shortcut connections** to the model architecture. Try to build a simple reusable \"residual block\" as a [Keras Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model). \n",
        "4. [**OPTIONAL**]. Visualise the filters of the convolutional layers using Matplotlib. **HINT**: You can retrieve a reference to an individual layer from the sequential Keras model by calling```model.get_layer(name)```, replacing \"name\" with the name of the layer. "
