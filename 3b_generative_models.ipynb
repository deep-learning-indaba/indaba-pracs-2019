One simple reason we're spending time on this is that it is a fun application of generative models, which gives us an excellent visual way of exploring how different models work. However, generating images itself has many interesting applications ranging from creating new fonts to making people smile in pictures, and from assisting with interactive design to creating photo-realistic images from drawn outlines (see [this cool article](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/) for more information on these applications). It should also be noted that many of the techniques presented in this practical apply to generative modelling in general and not just to generating images. Generative modelling has many interesting applications ranging from anomaly detection to missing data imputation, as well as, in leveraging abundant unsupervised data for representation learning (e.g. [BigBiGAN](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02544) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805))."

Firstly, a **generator network**, which we can train to take a random input (often called $z$) and produce a sample from some distribution, in this case, the distribution of 28 x 28 grayscale clothing images. Secondly, we have a **discriminator network**, which will learn to tell apart the real (training) data and the fake (generated) data. The generator is trained to trick the discriminator and the discriminator is trained to avoid being tricked. This process is described in the following diagram:\n",

We can use the standard cross-entropy loss function for a binary classifier. However, more interestingly, the generator's loss comes from performing back-propagation through the discriminator. In a sense, **the discriminator is the loss function for the generator**. While it may seem strange to train a neural network using another neural network as the loss function, rather than some pre-defined function, it turns out that training this way approximately minimizes something called the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which is a well motivated choice of loss function for generative models that we would be unable to calculate analytically.\n"

        "One of the most challenging parts of deep learning is choosing the architecture for our models. This issue is highlighted for GAN training, which is notoriously tricky. A GAN might work correctly with one architecture and fail to train at all with a slightly different architecture.  Furthermore, instabilities and pathologies are very common in GAN training, for example, the generator and discriminator might end up chasing each other in circles rather than converging. The good news is that GANs are an active area of research and several methods exist for making GANs train more reliably. One such method that works very well for images is the DCGAN architecture by _Radford et al._ which we will draw inspiration from to design our networks. Here are some tips from the [git repo](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code) for DCGAN:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions.\n",
        "* Use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator\n",
        "* Remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures. Just use average pooling at the end. \n",
        "* Use ReLU activations in the generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh. *(This means they are generating pixel values between -1 and 1.)*\n",
        "* Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use these guidelines to help us define our discriminator and generator, but you should experiment and see what happens if you make other choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exercise:** why do you think we use LeakyReLU and avoid the use of pooling layers? *Hint:* we want to make training as easy as possible."

For example, we've said that we are now doing unsupervised learning and that we do not need labels for our data. So you might now be wondering if this is always the case and whether there are other differences between the two kinds of models. In general, *generative models are not always unsupervised*; they can also be supervised or even semi-supervised. In these cases, labels are often used. Similarly, unsupervised learning is not always generative, for example, k-means clustering. The main difference between generative and discriminative modelling is the goal. The purpose of a discriminative model is to predict an output $y$ given an input $x$, as acurately as possible. On the other hand, the purpose of a generative model is to describe the process in which data is generated. This lets us create new examples of the data, often written $\\hat x$, but it can also help us to understand the underlying nature of the data. \n",

We'll start by building and training an autoencoder. After we've done that, we'll introduce a few changes that make an AE into a VAE. \n",
        "\n",
        "Autoencoders are networks trained unsupervised on input data (often images) that attempt to find a simple *code* to represent the input data. The main idea is to jointly train two sub-networks to cooperate: the *encoder* network, which takes an image and turns it into a code, and the *decoder* network, which takes a code and turns it back into a reconstructed image. (For non-image data, the basic idea is the same). The code is often called the *latent code* or *latent variable*, which lives in a *latent space*. The latent code uses the symbol $\\mathbf z$, whereas data typically uses the symbol $\\mathbf x$, and the reconstructed data uses the symbol $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$. In the case of MNIST, the input data is made of $28\\times28$ grayscale images. A typical latent code might be 100 dimensional, but the exact size is a hyperparameter that can be tuned &#8212; the only thing that matters is that it is smaller than the input dimension.\n",

        "Why do we want to learn a latent code for the data? There are a number of applications. An obvious one is that it allows us to *compress* our data, in a process called *dimensionality reduction*. By making the dimensionality of our latent code smaller than that of the data, we force the model to compress the important pieces of information into the code and discard the unimportant information. Another application is *representation learning*, which we mentioned briefly in the introduction. The idea behind representation learning is that we want different parts of our code to represent different aspects of our data. For example, one dimension of the code might represent whether or not a person is smiling, while another might represent a person's hair colour. Learning good representations of our data not only allows us to have fine control over the images we generate but also lets us build powerful image classifiers.\n",

However, this isn't always a bad thing. In some cases, when we have noisy images, we might want to throw away the noisy parts of the inputs. In this light, *autoencoders can be seen as a non-linear form of PCA*. In fact, in the case of single-layer encoders and decoders with tied weights, we  are doing ordinary PCA.\n",

The main difference is that rather than the encoder producing a code for a given input and the decoder using that code to reconstruct that input, **the encoder of a VAE produces the parameters of a probability distribution that explains the data**. More specifically, it produces the distribution $p(z|x)$. Then, given samples from this distribution, **the decoder generates new input data samples**. In other words, we have learnt a latent variable model for the data. Typically we treat each dimension of our latent space as being modelled with a Gaussian distribution with some mean $\\mu_z$ and variance $\\sigma_z^2$. \n",

Since the VAE is a little more complicated to train than an AE we'll define the training loop using  `tf.GradientTape()` rather than using `model.fit`. As you'll see, other than having to define the training loop and a slightly modified encoder architecture, a VAE is almost the same as an AE.
